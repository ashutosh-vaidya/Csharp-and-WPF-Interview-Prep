**What is the difference between WPF and Winforms? Why should we use WPF instead of WinForms**

**Ans:** Windows form is a legacy. WPF (Windows Presentation Framework) is a newer version. However, Winforms is still good and gets the job done.
Here are some benefits of WPF over WinForms:
1. WPF utilizes the video card via diretX which makes WPF UI better performance than WinForms
2. WPF supports media streaming such as audio, and video. 2D,3D animations.
3. WPF uses XAML for designing which gives a lot more flexibility to design. Even a designer who did not have knowledge of C# programming can easily work on XAML
4. XAML enables the use of Styles and themes which is somewhat similar to CSS. This gives a big boost in enriching the UI experience. 
5. Databinding is superior.
6. MVVM supports loose coupling and better unit test capabilities.
